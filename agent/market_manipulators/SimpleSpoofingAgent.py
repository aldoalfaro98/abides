    # The SpoofingAgent is a simple example of an agent that attempts to manipulate the price
    # of a stock for profit.  It takes a position in a particular stock, then maintains a significant
    # unexecuted order volume just beneath the spread.  The goal is to trick order book aware agents
    # into predicting a short-term price movement and positioning themselves accordingly, thus
    # driving stock prices in the direction that will be profitable for the spoofing agent.
    #
    # Parameters unique to this agent:
    # position_target: what real position should the spoofer try to profit from (sign indicates long/short)
    # lurk_ticks: how far from the inside should the spoofer lurk?
    # lurk_size: how much unexecuted volume should the spoofer maintain?
    # levels: how many order book levels does the agent need to consider?
    # exit_profit: how much profit (percent of entry level) should trigger our exit?
    # cooldown: how long should we wait after exit before re-entry?
    # freq: what should the order book subscription refresh frequency be?

            ### HERE: consider changing spoof level to "how many shares should I keep between
            ###       me and the inside of the book" ?  We don't know when another agent
            ###       might place a huge order that eats into a place we don't want executed.
            ###       (Because a lot of our agents are dumb and don't mind causing impact.)

            # Potential features to consider (manual or learning).  How far from midpoint is 50%
            # of total liquidity in that direction?  What percentage of volume is within 1% of the midpoint?
            # Build a decision tree from those factors?

            # Preliminary effort.  Given my exact knowledge of the config, hardcode a successful spoofer.
            # Then try to make the decision points of the tree some kind of more generic ratio or feature,
            # one at a time, and ensure it still succeeds.

            ### For now, let's just keep an order of 1000 shares at order book depth 5, to see if
            ### that does anything.  (The OBI agent should look that far...)

            ### but knows to ignore "position" orders.
